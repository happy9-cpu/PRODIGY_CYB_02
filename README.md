# PRODIGY_CYB_02 – Image Encryption & Decryption

This project is part of my Cybersecurity internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📌 Description
A Python-based tool that performs **image encryption and decryption** by manipulating pixel values with a numeric key.

The app includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using `tkinter` for easier interaction.

## 🔐 Features
- Encrypts any `.jpg` or `.png` image using pixel manipulation
- Decrypts back the image using the same key
- Built-in GUI for user-friendly operation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- `Pillow` (PIL) for image processing
- `Tkinter` for GUI

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Pillow installed:
